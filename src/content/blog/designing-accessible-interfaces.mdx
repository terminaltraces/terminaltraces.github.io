# Designing Accessible Interfaces

Accessibility in web design is often treated as a nice-to-have, but it's essential. Every user deserves a great experience, regardless of their abilities.

## What is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility means designing and developing websites that work for everyone, including people with:

- Visual impairments
- Hearing impairments
- Motor disabilities
- Cognitive disabilities
- Temporary disabilities (like a broken arm)

## The WCAG Standards

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a framework for creating accessible content. The core principles are:

1. **Perceivable** - Users can see or hear the content
2. **Operable** - Users can navigate using keyboard alone
3. **Understandable** - Content is clear and navigable
4. **Robust** - Works with assistive technologies

## Practical Tips

### 1. Semantic HTML

Use proper HTML elements for their intended purpose:

```html
<!-- ✅ Good -->
<button>Click me</button>
<nav>Navigation</nav>
<main>Main content</main>

<!-- ❌ Avoid -->
<div onclick="handleClick()">Click me</div>
```

### 2. Color Contrast

Text should have sufficient contrast against its background. Aim for at least 4.5:1 for normal text.

### 3. Keyboard Navigation

All functionality should be accessible via keyboard:

```html
<!-- Ensure proper focus management -->
<button onKeyDown={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && handleClick()}>
  Accessible Button
</button>
```

### 4. Alt Text for Images

Every image needs descriptive alt text:

```html
<img src="galaxy.jpg" alt="A vibrant purple and pink galaxy with stars" />
```

### 5. ARIA Labels

Use ARIA attributes when semantics aren't sufficient:

```html
<button aria-label="Close menu" aria-expanded="false">×</button>
```

## Testing for Accessibility

- Use screen readers like NVDA or VoiceOver
- Test keyboard-only navigation
- Use accessibility audit tools like axe DevTools
- Have people with disabilities test your site

## The Business Case

Beyond ethics, accessibility improves:

- **SEO** - Better semantic markup helps search engines
- **Performance** - Accessible code is often more performant
- **Usability** - Benefits everyone, not just people with disabilities

Remember: Accessibility is not a checklist item—it's a mindset. Build with everyone in mind.
