# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern web framework that brings a fresh perspective to web development. Let me share my experience diving into this framework.

## Why Astro?

When I first encountered Astro, I was impressed by its core philosophy: **ship less JavaScript**. In a world where web frameworks often bloat our applications with unnecessary code, Astro takes a different approach.

### Key Benefits:

- **Zero JavaScript by default** - Only ship JS when you need it
- **Island Architecture** - Isolated components that hydrate independently
- **Built for content** - Perfect for blogs and documentation sites
- **Multiple Framework Support** - Use React, Vue, Svelte, and more together

## Setting Up Your First Project

Getting started is incredibly simple:

```bash
npm create astro@latest my-project
cd my-project
npm run dev
```

That's it! You now have a modern Astro project running.

## Understanding the File Structure

```
src/
├── pages/        # File-based routing
├── components/   # Reusable components
├── layouts/      # Layout templates
└── content/      # Markdown/MDX content
```

Each `.astro` file in the `pages` directory automatically becomes a route.

## Creating Your First Component

Astro components are a hybrid of HTML templates and frontmatter:

```astro
---
// This runs on the server only
const { title } = Astro.props;
---

<div class="greeting">
  <h1>{title}</h1>
  <p>This HTML will be sent to the browser with zero JavaScript!</p>
</div>

<style>
  .greeting {
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
</style>
```

## Islands of Interactivity

Need JavaScript? Use React, Vue, or Svelte islands:

```astro
---
import MyReactComponent from '../components/MyReactComponent.jsx';
---

<MyReactComponent client:load />
```

The `client:load` directive tells Astro to hydrate this component in the browser.

## Final Thoughts

Astro represents a paradigm shift in how we think about web frameworks. By prioritizing performance and developer experience, it's become my go-to choice for building fast, accessible websites.

If you're interested in modern web development, I highly recommend giving Astro a try!
