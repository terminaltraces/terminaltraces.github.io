# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

This repository is now configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

## What Was Done

1. **Astro Configuration Updated**: The `astro.config.mjs` now explicitly sets `output: 'static'` for GitHub Pages compatibility.

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow Added**: A deployment workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that:
   - Triggers on pushes to the `main` branch
   - Uses the official Astro GitHub Action (`withastro/action@v2`)
   - Automatically builds and deploys to GitHub Pages

3. **Static Assets Added**:
   - `.nojekyll` file to prevent Jekyll processing
   - `favicon.svg` for proper site favicon

## Required Setup

To complete the GitHub Pages deployment, you need to:

1. **Enable GitHub Actions for Pages**:
   - Go to your repository Settings
   - Navigate to Pages (in the left sidebar)
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions" instead of "Deploy from a branch"

2. **Merge this PR to main**: Once merged, the workflow will automatically:
   - Build the Astro site
   - Deploy it to GitHub Pages
   - Make it available at https://terminaltraces.github.io

## How It Works

- **Automatic Deployment**: Every push to `main` triggers a build and deploy
- **Static Site Generation**: Astro builds a completely static site optimized for GitHub Pages
- **Asset Optimization**: CSS, JS, and images are optimized and properly linked
- **SEO Ready**: Meta tags and proper URLs are configured for the site

## Manual Testing

You can test the build locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The site will be available at http://localhost:4321

## Troubleshooting

If the deployment fails:
1. Check the Actions tab in your repository for error logs
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is set to use GitHub Actions as the source
3. Verify the workflow has the necessary permissions (already configured)

Your site will be live at https://terminaltraces.github.io once the setup is complete!
